# ng-inline-confirm
A simple, yet highly customisable AngularJS 1.x directive to elegantly confirm destructive and irreversible actions (like delete), in an unobstrusive manner.

![Illustration](https://github.com/spkarve/ng-inline-confirm/blob/master/illustration-01.png)

Note that the revert / cancel button is placed below the trigger, so an accidental double click never causes the confirmation step to be unintentionally skipped.

##Context
Do you still ask for confirmations using `alert()` ? *Hopefully not* ! Using modal confirmation dialogs instead ? *Better* !

![Modal confirmation](http://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Lightweight-Modal-Dialog-Plugin-For-Bootstrap-Bootstrap-Confirm.jpg)

That said, modal dialogs still require the user to do a context-switch. Also, it is commonly accepted that users involuntarily jump to do whatever it takes to dismiss the dialog, without reading through the message shown. This defeats the purpose of a *confirmation* step.

As an elegant and (hopefully) effective alternative, I have created the inline-confirm.

##Installation

* Just drop the two files into any appropriate folder in your project.
* Edit the module name in the JS file to whatever suits you
* Make sure the module is listed as a dependency at the appropriate point of use

That's it !

##Options

###Behaviour
`if-confirmed` (required): Callback function for 'positive' outcome

`if-reverted` (optional) : Callback function for 'negative' outcome

`disable-if` (optional) : If specified, the referenced variable will be used to determine enable/disable state of the trigger button

###Appearance

`btn-size` (optional) : Valid options : [xs, sm, lg]

`trigger-icon` (optional) : Icon for the trigger button

`trigger-text` (optional) : Label for the trigger button

`class` (optional) : Space separated list of CSS classes. These will be added to the trigger as well as the positive & negative action buttons

##CSS classes
These classes are present on the HTML elements generated by this directive. You need to define the styles yourself.
