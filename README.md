# ng-inline-confirm
A simple AngularJS 1.x directive to display an inline confirmation for potentially destructive actions (like delete)

##Context
Do you still ask for confirmations using `alert()` ? *Hopefully not* ! Using modal confirmation dialogs instead ? *Better* !

That said, modal dialogs still require the user to do a context-switch. Also, it is commonly accepted that users involuntarily jump to do whatever it takes to dismiss the dialog, without reading through the message shown. This defeats the purpose of a *confirmation* step.

As an elegant and (hopefully) effective alternative, I have created the inline-confirm.

##Options

###Behaviour
`if-confirmed` (required): Callback function for 'positive' outcome

`if-reverted` (optional) : Callback function for 'negative' outcome

`disable-if` (optional) : If specified, the referenced variable will be used to determine enable/disable state of the trigger button

###Appearance

`btn-size` (optional) : Valid options : [xs, sm, lg]

`trigger-icon` (optional) : Icon for the trigger button

`trigger-text` (optional) : Label for the trigger button

`confirm-icon` (optional) : Icon class for the 'positive' confirmation button

`confirm-text` (optional) : Label for the 'positive' confirmation button

`revert-icon` (optional) : Icon class for the 'negative' confirmation button

`revert-text` (optional) : Label for the 'negative' confirmation button

`class` (optional) : Space separated list of CSS classes. These will be added to the trigger as well as the positive & negative action buttons

##CSS classes
These classes are present on the HTML elements generated by this directive. You need to define the styles yourself.

`inline-confirm-trigger` : For the button that will trigger the confirmation options

`inline-confirm-yes` : For the positive confirmation button

`inline-confirm-no` : For the negative confirmation button
